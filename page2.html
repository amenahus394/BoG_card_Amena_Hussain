<h2>2nd Year Computer Science Major</h2>


<i>passionate about aiding children with little access to education</i>


<p1>As a former Vibha social good organization member, I had the opportunity to
    talk to two children who were living on the streets of India and procuring
    educational resources from this organization. Seeing their enthusiam and 
    gratitude towards receiving what should be just a fundamental resource for 
    every child was very eye-opening, and I hope that I can continue to work
    towards this cause through Bits of Good. 

    I've also been lucky enough to spend a lot of time organizing volunteers
    and different fundraisers and drives for local organizations and causes, including
    COVID-Relief, art therapy, our local animal shelter, and domestic violence shelters
    in my hometown in New Jersey. I have been looking for a way to combine my current interests in computer science 
    with my past involvement in social good, and think that Bits of Good is a great medium to do so!
